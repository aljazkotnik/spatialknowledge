/*
This class should connect with the server to get and save the knowledge captured.

Where should the tree be drawn also? Top left, as before?


Where in the code hierarchy should KnowledgeManager sit? Below or above NavigationManager. Maybe above is fine?

What kind of knowledge is there, and what does it need to interact with, and how:

- Structured tags: name/value pairs equivalent to ordinal/categorical metadata variables
	ordinal name-spatial value pairs: global menu
	categorical name-spatial value pairs: global menu
- Unstructured tags: keywords saved as a list for each metadata row
    name: existing chapter form
- Annotations: timestamp/line/area data with a keyword attached
    name-timestep: existing chapter form
	name-line: drawing interaction
	name-area: drawing interaction
- Comments:
	text: exiting comment form


All properties	
id, taskId, author, datetime, name, value, timestamps, geometry, comment, upvotes, downvotes


Compulsory properties:
id, taskId, author, datetime, name


The id should be an annotation specific id!!! What should this be??? Just sequential numbers? Assigned at the server?

The tree should only track the knowledge, and not all the taskIds.
*/




/*
      Database doesn't exist yet - create Knowledge table. Single table could hold all possible annotations.
      
      id - annotation id, created on the fly by SQL table
      type - annotation type (tag, chapter, name-value pair,...)
      taskId - the taskId it corresponds to
      author - who contributed the knowledge
      datetime - when was it contributed, created server side
      name - tag name
      value - tag value
      timestamps - chapter start and end times saved as stringified array
      geometry - stringified array of [x,y] arrays
      comment - text comment
      upvotes - string of authors that upvoted, with special server-side update method
      downvotes - string of authros who downvoted, with special server-side update method
*/

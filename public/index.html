	<p>Exploratory visual analysis is a key initial step in the derivation of transferable learning from a dataset. In many cases, the data being studied is best represented by images, or small multiples, that can be manipulated and analysed interactively. During this process, the experienced domain practitioner (a scientist or engineer, for example) is alert to the possibilities that may be uncovered and makes many decisions and hypothesis tests as part of an exploration session. The majority of these ideas are never captured and are lost; they cannot be considered, either by the same individual or a wider team, during future exploration. Where knowledge is captured, it is often recorded in documents that are detached from the data that supports the conclusions drawn. To accelerate exploration and enable knowledge capture, we propose a Visual Analytics environment for analysing image-based ensemble datasets, with image spatial arrangement and piling as the fundamental interactions. The testing of the ideas and hypotheses made by the user is supported using correlations between the spatial arrangement of small multiples and their associated metadata. The environment is capable of capturing observations (such as tags, value estimates, tagged image segments, and time delimited events) and text descriptions, and allows for real-time collaboration of multiple users. A tree visualisation is used to synthesise different types of annotations, support several points of view, and allow navigation between different groups of images created by the user. The utility of this framework for small multiple exploration and knowledge capture is illustrated with example datasets from chess game analysis and engineering simulation.</p>
